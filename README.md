# Alien: Isolation PAK Tool
A tool to preview, export, and re-import files within Alien: Isolation's PAK archives.

The latest stable version can be found [on the releases tab](https://github.com/MattFiler/AlienPAK/releases).

An important note: make sure the tool is closed when you launch the game. If the tool has a PAK open the game will not be able to read it and this will lead to a crash.

[JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) is recommended for editing exported UI .GFX files!

***This project is currently a work in progress!***
